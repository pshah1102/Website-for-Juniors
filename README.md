## Introduction
Build Communication provides an immersive experience for kids to develop and enhance their vocal as well as acoustic skills through interactive modules. The modules are divided on the basis of sounds each having different words with a similar sound in it. Each module is designed in such a way that once a kid completes a module than the kid becomes confident in pronouncing those type of words.
